# Data Engineering for Beginners

Code for the [Data Engineering for Beginners e-book](https://www.startdataengineering.com/).

## Setup

The code for SQL, Python, and data model sections are written using Spark SQL. In order to run the code, you will need the below pre-requisites.

### Prerequisites

1. [git version >= 2.37.1](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git)
2. [Docker version >= 20.10.17](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and [Docker compose v2 version >= v2.10.2](https://docs.docker.com/compose/#compose-v2-and-the-new-docker-compose-command).

**Windows users**: please setup WSL and a local Ubuntu Virtual machine following **[the instructions here](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-on-wsl2-on-windows-10#1-overview)**. Install the above prerequisites on your ubuntu terminal; if you have trouble installing docker, follow **[the steps here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-on-ubuntu-22-04#step-1-installing-docker)** (only Step 1 is necessary). Please install the **make** command with `sudo apt install make -y` (if its not already present). 


### Starting and stopping containers

In your terminal, clone this repo, cd into it and start the containers as shown below:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/josephmachado/data_engineering_for_beginners_code.git
cd data_engineering_for_beginners_code
docker compose up -d 
sleep 30 
```

Open the Jupyter notebook at [http://localhost:8888/lab/tree/notebooks](http://localhost:8888/lab/tree/notebooks). When creating a new notebook make sure to select the `Python 3 (ipykernel)` Notebook.

When you are done stop docker containers with the below command:

```bash
docker compose down 
```
